First, check for visible defects that penetrate beyond the superficial layer and disrupt the smooth surface continuity. If the defect resembles a hole or puncture, classify it as a hole. If it resembles a crack, classify it as a crack. If neither applies, examine the item for any physical deformities such as squeezing. If a deformity is present, classify it as a physical deformation.

The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect.

The normal capsule appears to be in good condition with no visible defects or damage. The '500' label on the brownish-orange part is clear and legible, and any rotational misalignment of the black part is acceptable. Defect classification must follow a strict hierarchy. First, check for visible defects that penetrate beyond the superficial layer and disrupt the smooth surface continuity. If the defect resembles a hole or puncture, classify it as a hole. If it resembles a crack, classify it as a crack. If neither applies, examine the item for any physical deformities such as squeezing. If a deformity is present, classify it as a physical deformation. If no deformities are found, check for surface scratches. If scratches are present, classify the defect as a scratch. If there are no scratches, assess the imprint quality of the '500' label. If the imprint is faulty, classify it as a faulty imprint defect. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. crack: identified as a visible defect on the surface of the capsule that penetrates deeper than the superficial layer and breaks the smooth surface continuity. Cracks can be visible on either the black or brownish-orange part of the capsule. Typical signs of a crack include the presence of underlying material, which may sometimes appear as a whitish substance leaking or accumulating around the crack, 2. hole: identifies as a visible defect on the surface of the capsule that penetrates deeper than the superficial layer and breaks the smooth surface continuity. Holes can be visible on either the black or brownish-orange part of the capsule. Typical signs of a hole include the presence of underlying material, which may sometimes appear as a whitish substance leaking or accumulating around the hole, 3. faulty imprint: partial or complete fault in imprint of label 500, 4. scratch: visible scratches or scuff marks on its surface. These scratches might be linear or randomly oriented. They affect only the superficial layer of the capsule without penetrating deeper into the shell and without presence of whitish substance, 5. physical deformation: physical deformities such as squeezing, denting, or warping. These deformities alter the shape of the capsule without causing any breach in the capsule's shell. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

First, check for visible defects that penetrate beyond the superficial layer and disrupt the smooth surface continuity. If the defect resembles a hole or puncture, classify it as a hole. If it resembles a crack, classify it as a crack. If neither applies, examine the item for any physical deformities such as squeezing. If a deformity is present, classify it as a physical deformation. If no deformities are found, check for surface scratches. If scratches are present, classify the defect as a scratch. If there are no scratches, assess the imprint quality of the '500' label. If the imprint is faulty, classify it as a faulty imprint defect. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. crack: identified as a visible defect on the surface of the capsule that penetrates deeper than the superficial layer and breaks the smooth surface continuity. Cracks can be visible on either the black or brownish-orange part of the capsule. Typical signs of a crack include the presence of underlying material, which may sometimes appear as a whitish substance leaking or accumulating around the crack, 2. hole: identifies as a visible defect on the surface of the capsule that penetrates deeper than the superficial layer and breaks the smooth surface continuity. Holes can be visible on either the black or brownish-orange part of the capsule. Typical signs of a hole include the presence of underlying material, which may sometimes appear as a whitish substance leaking or accumulating around the hole, 3. faulty imprint: partial or complete fault in imprint of label 500, 4. scratch: visible scratches or scuff marks on its surface. These scratches might be linear or randomly oriented. They affect only the superficial layer of the capsule without penetrating deeper into the shell and without presence of whitish substance, 5. physical deformation: physical deformities such as squeezing, denting, or warping. These deformities alter the shape of the capsule without causing any breach in the capsule's shell. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

If it resembles a crack, classify it as a crack. If neither applies, examine the item for any physical deformities such as squeezing. If a deformity is present, classify it as a physical deformation. If no deformities are found, check for surface scratches. If scratches are present, classify the defect as a scratch. If there are no scratches, assess the imprint quality of the '500' label. If the imprint is faulty, classify it as a faulty imprint defect. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. crack: identified as a visible defect on the surface of the capsule that penetrates deeper than the superficial layer and breaks the smooth surface continuity. Cracks can be visible on either the black or brownish-orange part of the capsule. Typical signs of a crack include the presence of underlying material, which may sometimes appear as a whitish substance leaking or accumulating around the crack, 2. hole: identifies as a visible defect on the surface of the capsule that penetrates deeper than the superficial layer and breaks the smooth surface continuity. Holes can be visible on either the black or brownish-orange part of the capsule. Typical signs of a hole include the presence of underlying material, which may sometimes appear as a whitish substance leaking or accumulating around the hole, 3. faulty imprint: partial or complete fault in imprint of label 500, 4. scratch: visible scratches or scuff marks on its surface. These scratches might be linear or randomly oriented. They affect only the superficial layer of the capsule without penetrating deeper into the shell and without presence of whitish substance, 5. physical deformation: physical deformities such as squeezing, denting, or warping. These deformities alter the shape of the capsule without causing any breach in the capsule's shell. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. crack: identified as a visible defect on the surface of the capsule that penetrates deeper than the superficial layer and breaks the smooth surface continuity. Cracks can be visible on either the black or brownish-orange part of the capsule. Typical signs of a crack include the presence of underlying material, which may sometimes appear as a whitish substance leaking or accumulating around the crack, 2. hole: identifies as a visible defect on the surface of the capsule that penetrates deeper than the superficial layer and breaks the smooth surface continuity. Holes can be visible on either the black or brownish-orange part of the capsule. Typical signs of a hole include the presence of underlying material, which may sometimes appear as a whitish substance leaking or accumulating around the hole, 3. faulty imprint: partial or complete fault in imprint of label 500, 4. scratch: visible scratches or scuff marks on its surface. These scratches might be linear or randomly oriented. They affect only the superficial layer of the capsule without penetrating deeper into the shell and without presence of whitish substance, 5. physical deformation: physical deformities such as squeezing, denting, or warping. These deformities alter the shape of the capsule without causing any breach in the capsule's shell. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

The normal capsule appears to be in good condition with no visible defects or damage. The '500' label on the brownish-orange part is clear and legible, and any rotational misalignment of the black part is acceptable. Defect classification must follow a strict hierarchy. First, check for visible defects that penetrate beyond the superficial layer and disrupt the smooth surface continuity. If the defect resembles a hole or puncture, classify it as a hole. If it resembles a crack, classify it as a crack. If neither applies, examine the item for any physical deformities such as squeezing. If a deformity is present, classify it as a physical deformation. If no deformities are found, check for surface scratches. If scratches are present, classify the defect as a scratch. If there are no scratches, assess the imprint quality of the '500' label. If the imprint is faulty, classify it as a faulty imprint defect. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. crack: identified as a visible defect on the surface of the capsule that penetrates deeper than the superficial layer and breaks the smooth surface continuity. Cracks can be visible on either the black or brownish-orange part of the capsule. Typical signs of a crack include the presence of underlying material, which may sometimes appear as a whitish substance leaking or accumulating around the crack, 2. hole: identifies as a visible defect on the surface of the capsule that penetrates deeper than the superficial layer and breaks the smooth surface continuity. Holes can be visible on either the black or brownish-orange part of the capsule. Typical signs of a hole include the presence of underlying material, which may sometimes appear as a whitish substance leaking or accumulating around the hole, 3. faulty imprint: partial or complete fault in imprint of label 500, 4. scratch: visible scratches or scuff marks on its surface. These scratches might be linear or randomly oriented. They affect only the superficial layer of the capsule without penetrating deeper into the shell and without presence of whitish substance, 5. physical deformation: physical deformities such as squeezing, denting, or warping. These deformities alter the shape of the capsule without causing any breach in the capsule's shell. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

If it resembles a crack, classify it as a crack. If neither applies, examine the item for any physical deformities such as squeezing. If a deformity is present, classify it as a physical deformation. If no deformities are found, check for surface scratches. If scratches are present, classify the defect as a scratch. If there are no scratches, assess the imprint quality of the '500' label. If the imprint is faulty, classify it as a faulty imprint defect. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. crack: identified as a visible defect on the surface of the capsule that penetrates deeper than the superficial layer and breaks the smooth surface continuity. Cracks can be visible on either the black or brownish-orange part of the capsule. Typical signs of a crack include the presence of underlying material, which may sometimes appear as a whitish substance leaking or accumulating around the crack, 2. hole: identifies as a visible defect on the surface of the capsule that penetrates deeper than the superficial layer and breaks the smooth surface continuity. Holes can be visible on either the black or brownish-orange part of the capsule. Typical signs of a hole include the presence of underlying material, which may sometimes appear as a whitish substance leaking or accumulating around the hole, 3. faulty imprint: partial or complete fault in imprint of label 500, 4. scratch: visible scratches or scuff marks on its surface. These scratches might be linear or randomly oriented. They affect only the superficial layer of the capsule without penetrating deeper into the shell and without presence of whitish substance, 5. physical deformation: physical deformities such as squeezing, denting, or warping. These deformities alter the shape of the capsule without causing any breach in the capsule's shell. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

The normal carpet has uniform and tightly woven pattern, free of any visible defects such as stains, frayed edges, or loose threads. The fibers are intact and consistently distributed, ensuring both aesthetic appeal and structural integrity. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First look at anomaly location and check for change of color. If darkish, blueish, or redish mark persent, the defect is color stain. If not, check for foreign object in the anomaly location. If there is a small metalic-type object sometimes shiny with colors similar to the carpet, it is foreign object intrusion. If not, check for extra piece of foreign loose thread, the defect is thread. If not, check for cut or hole. If the defect looks like a tearing or cut, the defect is cut. If the defect looks like a gap or hole, the defect is hole. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. color stain: colored spot (dark, blue, or red), indicating a stain or spill that has been absorbed into the carpet fibers, 2. cut: tear resulting from cuts, or missing threads in the fabric weave, 3. hole: gaps or holes that do not look like a cut, 4. foreign object intrusion: presence of extraneous materials such as metallic pieces embedded in the carpet weave, 5. thread: loose extra thread piece protruding from the carpet surface.

The normal carpet has uniform and tightly woven pattern, free of any visible defects such as stains, frayed edges, or loose threads. The fibers are intact and consistently distributed, ensuring both aesthetic appeal and structural integrity. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First look at anomaly location and check for change of color. If darkish, blueish, or redish mark persent, the defect is color stain. If not, check for foreign object in the anomaly location. If there is a small metalic-type object sometimes shiny with colors similar to the carpet, it is foreign object intrusion. If not, check for extra piece of foreign loose thread, the defect is thread. If not, check for cut or hole. If the defect looks like a tearing or cut, the defect is cut. If the defect looks like a gap or hole, the defect is hole. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. color stain: colored spot (dark, blue, or red), indicating a stain or spill that has been absorbed into the carpet fibers, 2. cut: tear resulting from cuts, or missing threads in the fabric weave, 3. hole: gaps or holes that do not look like a cut, 4. foreign object intrusion: presence of extraneous materials such as metallic pieces embedded in the carpet weave, 5. thread: loose extra thread piece protruding from the carpet surface.

If not, check for foreign object in the anomaly location. If there is a small metalic-type object sometimes shiny with colors similar to the carpet, it is foreign object intrusion. If not, check for extra piece of foreign loose thread, the defect is thread. If not, check for cut or hole. If the defect looks like a tearing or cut, the defect is cut. If the defect looks like a gap or hole, the defect is hole. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. color stain: colored spot (dark, blue, or red), indicating a stain or spill that has been absorbed into the carpet fibers, 2. cut: tear resulting from cuts, or missing threads in the fabric weave, 3. hole: gaps or holes that do not look like a cut, 4. foreign object intrusion: presence of extraneous materials such as metallic pieces embedded in the carpet weave, 5. thread: loose extra thread piece protruding from the carpet surface.

Contamination overrides all other defect types and visual shape analysis is only relevant after contamination is ruled out. If no contamination is found, examine the surface for structural defects: prioritize folded ridge anomalies (raised areas or strips caused by folding). If no folds are present, check for cut and puncture hole defects. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. color irregularities: Unintended light grayish or redish discolorations on the leather surface that visibly contrast with the surrounding materiale, 2. cut: cut, slit, or tear on the leather surface. The cut may include a small hole but is distinguished by the presence of a linear or curved opening extending outward from the puncture point. If any color irregularities are present, even if the defect visually resembles a cut, it should be classified as contamination instead, 3. folded ridge: a raised area or strip in the leather caused by folding, 4. glue contamination: The presence of a transparent foreign substance or wet mark, often appearing as a transparent residue or a slightly darker area than the leather itself, suggesting glue, liquid, or embedded material, 5. puncture hole: a small, isolated, visible hole penetrating through the leather surface, without any visible cuts or tears extending from it.

If the anomaly involves only part of the metal nut and there are no abnormal color marks, the defect is either edge deformation or a scratch. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. distorted hexagonal: irregularly shaped lobes, leading to a loss of the characteristic hexagonal symmetry, 2. color contamination: abnormal blue, dark, or red colors on the surface of the metal nut, 3. edge deformations: irregularities and distortions along the edges of the nut, appearing to include extra metal pieces or protrusions along the edge, 4. scratch: visible scratches or abrasions on the surface of the metal nut.

The normal metal_nut  have an irregular pentagonal shape with a central threaded hole. The surface textures and edges are relatively consistent, but with some visible wear or surface inconsistencies as typical for metal parts. Follow this strict hierarchy to classify the anomaly: first, check if the anomaly involves the entire metal nut, which indicates a distorted hexagonal defect. If the anomaly involves only part of the metal nut, check if it is related to abnormal color marks, indicating color contamination. If the anomaly involves only part of the metal nut and there are no abnormal color marks, the defect is either edge deformation or a scratch. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. distorted hexagonal: irregularly shaped lobes, leading to a loss of the characteristic hexagonal symmetry, 2. color contamination: abnormal blue, dark, or red colors on the surface of the metal nut, 3. edge deformations: irregularities and distortions along the edges of the nut, appearing to include extra metal pieces or protrusions along the edge, 4. scratch: visible scratches or abrasions on the surface of the metal nut.

The normal pill has white and oval shape, with red speckling uniformly distributed across the surface. The FF logo is imprinted on one side. The overall appearance is consistent across different units. The most important factor in classifying defects is their location. Follow this strict hierarchy to classify the anomaly: first, check if the detected anomaly involves the entire pill, indicating pill type; if not, check if the FF logo is partially missing, indicating faulty imprint; if neither, check if the anomaly is strictly on the edges with broken parts, indicating crack; otherwise, the defect is either color contamination, protrusion deformities, or scratch. Finally, if multiple defects are present the defect class is multiple defects. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. color contamination: unintended spots or marks, streak, or patches of different colors (bright red, dark blue, solid red, yellow) are present on the pill's surface, 2. protrusion deformities: abnormal bumps or protrusions on the pill's surface, indicating contamination or impurities, 3. chipped edge: missing parts along the edge, indicating chopping or breakage. This anomaly strictly pertains to the edges of the pill, 4. faulty imprints: the imprinted FF logo is partially missing, 5. pill type: uneven pigmentation and unusual coloration, differing significantly from the normal uniform appearance, 6. scratch: visible surface imperfections such as scratches or indented marks, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects.

Follow this strict hierarchy to classify the anomaly: first, check if the detected anomaly involves the entire pill, indicating pill type; if not, check if the FF logo is partially missing, indicating faulty imprint; if neither, check if the anomaly is strictly on the edges with broken parts, indicating crack; otherwise, the defect is either color contamination, protrusion deformities, or scratch. Finally, if multiple defects are present the defect class is multiple defects. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. color contamination: unintended spots or marks, streak, or patches of different colors (bright red, dark blue, solid red, yellow) are present on the pill's surface, 2. protrusion deformities: abnormal bumps or protrusions on the pill's surface, indicating contamination or impurities, 3. chipped edge: missing parts along the edge, indicating chopping or breakage. This anomaly strictly pertains to the edges of the pill, 4. faulty imprints: the imprinted FF logo is partially missing, 5. pill type: uneven pigmentation and unusual coloration, differing significantly from the normal uniform appearance, 6. scratch: visible surface imperfections such as scratches or indented marks, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects.

The normal pill has white and oval shape, with red speckling uniformly distributed across the surface. The FF logo is imprinted on one side. The overall appearance is consistent across different units. The most important factor in classifying defects is their location. Follow this strict hierarchy to classify the anomaly: first, check if the detected anomaly involves the entire pill, indicating pill type; if not, check if the FF logo is partially missing, indicating faulty imprint; if neither, check if the anomaly is strictly on the edges with broken parts, indicating crack; otherwise, the defect is either color contamination, protrusion deformities, or scratch. Finally, if multiple defects are present the defect class is multiple defects. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. color contamination: unintended spots or marks, streak, or patches of different colors (bright red, dark blue, solid red, yellow) are present on the pill's surface, 2. protrusion deformities: abnormal bumps or protrusions on the pill's surface, indicating contamination or impurities, 3. chipped edge: missing parts along the edge, indicating chopping or breakage. This anomaly strictly pertains to the edges of the pill, 4. faulty imprints: the imprinted FF logo is partially missing, 5. pill type: uneven pigmentation and unusual coloration, differing significantly from the normal uniform appearance, 6. scratch: visible surface imperfections such as scratches or indented marks, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects.

Follow this strict hierarchy to classify the anomaly: first, check if the detected anomaly involves the entire pill, indicating pill type; if not, check if the FF logo is partially missing, indicating faulty imprint; if neither, check if the anomaly is strictly on the edges with broken parts, indicating crack; otherwise, the defect is either color contamination, protrusion deformities, or scratch. Finally, if multiple defects are present the defect class is multiple defects. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. color contamination: unintended spots or marks, streak, or patches of different colors (bright red, dark blue, solid red, yellow) are present on the pill's surface, 2. protrusion deformities: abnormal bumps or protrusions on the pill's surface, indicating contamination or impurities, 3. chipped edge: missing parts along the edge, indicating chopping or breakage. This anomaly strictly pertains to the edges of the pill, 4. faulty imprints: the imprinted FF logo is partially missing, 5. pill type: uneven pigmentation and unusual coloration, differing significantly from the normal uniform appearance, 6. scratch: visible surface imperfections such as scratches or indented marks, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects.

Follow this strict hierarchy to classify the anomaly: first, check if the detected anomaly involves the entire pill, indicating pill type; if not, check if the FF logo is partially missing, indicating faulty imprint; if neither, check if the anomaly is strictly on the edges with broken parts, indicating crack; otherwise, the defect is either color contamination, protrusion deformities, or scratch. Finally, if multiple defects are present the defect class is multiple defects. The predicted anomaly location may be noisy, so the model should still classify the defect correctly even if the predicted location is incorrect. The anomaly classes are: 1. color contamination: unintended spots or marks, streak, or patches of different colors (bright red, dark blue, solid red, yellow) are present on the pill's surface, 2. protrusion deformities: abnormal bumps or protrusions on the pill's surface, indicating contamination or impurities, 3. chipped edge: missing parts along the edge, indicating chopping or breakage. This anomaly strictly pertains to the edges of the pill, 4. faulty imprints: the imprinted FF logo is partially missing, 5. pill type: uneven pigmentation and unusual coloration, differing significantly from the normal uniform appearance, 6. scratch: visible surface imperfections such as scratches or indented marks, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects.

If it only involves parts of the black package, the defect is chipped package. If neither applies and the anomaly involves a lead, always check its length first. If it is shorter characterized by red line contour directed to the protoboard without silver lead, classify it as cut lead immediately. Only if the lead is full-length characterized by contour lines that contains silver lead should it be classified as bent lead. The anomaly classes are: 1. bent lead: one of the leads is protruding or fraying out but with a full length, 2. cut lead: one lead is partially cut. The defining characteristic is that the lead appears shortened or truncated compared to the others. The cut lead does not show a change in direction but rather a reduction in length, 3. chipped package: damage in the encapsulating packages, often resulting in the exposure of internal components, 4. mispositioned: transistor is either entirely absent from the protoboard, placed incorrectly such that it does not maintain the proper orientation, or has more than one lead bent or misaligned.

The anomaly classes are: 1. bent lead: one of the leads is protruding or fraying out but with a full length, 2. cut lead: one lead is partially cut. The defining characteristic is that the lead appears shortened or truncated compared to the others. The cut lead does not show a change in direction but rather a reduction in length, 3. chipped package: damage in the encapsulating packages, often resulting in the exposure of internal components, 4. mispositioned: transistor is either entirely absent from the protoboard, placed incorrectly such that it does not maintain the proper orientation, or has more than one lead bent or misaligned.

The normal zipper features two primary components: consists of two primary components: the tape and the coil. The tape is a fabric strip with a uniform texture and color, free from fraying or pilling. The coil is made of durable material, interlocking evenly with consistent spacing, and has a smooth surface without deformation. Classify the anomaly following this strict hierarchy: Location is the primary condition. First, determine if the anomaly is on the tape or the coil. If on the tape: if touches the outermost edge, it is frayed tape edges; if on fabric adjacent to the zipper but not touching the edge, it is fabric pilling. If on the coil: if portion of the surface looks rough, the defect is rough coil; If portion of the surface looks shiny, the defect is shiny coil; if the chain is partially unzipped with a minor gap, it is partial split; if the coil is squeezed or compressed, it is compression distortion. Finally, if multiple defects are present the defect class is multiple defects. Note that the predicted anomaly location is noisy, so the model should be able to classify the defect even if the predicted anomaly location is wrong. The anomaly classes are: 1. frayed tape edges: the textile tape edges have visible fraying or unraveling. This anomaly is strictly confined to the outermost edges of the zipper tape, regardless of texture, 2. fabric pilling: characterized by the presence of small balls of fiber on the fabric adjacent to the zipper, but crucially not on the edge. It lies between the very border of the tape and zipper. This anomaly impacts the fabric surrounding the zipper rather than the coil or teeth themselves, 3. shiny coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual shiny surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including any unusual shine. Additionally, this anomaly may sometimes cause the fabric to lie on the coil teeth themselves instead of just beside them, 4. rough coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual rough surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including rough or jagged edges, 5. partial split: chain is partially unzipped in a small section, causing a minor gap between the teeth, 6. compression distortion: coil appears deformed due to being tightly compressed, squeezed, or pinched. This distortion typically causes the individual teeth of the coil to overlap horizontally, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects. Choose the anomaly class of the image.

The normal zipper features two primary components: consists of two primary components: the tape and the coil. The tape is a fabric strip with a uniform texture and color, free from fraying or pilling. The coil is made of durable material, interlocking evenly with consistent spacing, and has a smooth surface without deformation. Classify the anomaly following this strict hierarchy: Location is the primary condition. First, determine if the anomaly is on the tape or the coil. If on the tape: if touches the outermost edge, it is frayed tape edges; if on fabric adjacent to the zipper but not touching the edge, it is fabric pilling. If on the coil: if portion of the surface looks rough, the defect is rough coil; If portion of the surface looks shiny, the defect is shiny coil; if the chain is partially unzipped with a minor gap, it is partial split; if the coil is squeezed or compressed, it is compression distortion. Finally, if multiple defects are present the defect class is multiple defects. Note that the predicted anomaly location is noisy, so the model should be able to classify the defect even if the predicted anomaly location is wrong. The anomaly classes are: 1. frayed tape edges: the textile tape edges have visible fraying or unraveling. This anomaly is strictly confined to the outermost edges of the zipper tape, regardless of texture, 2. fabric pilling: characterized by the presence of small balls of fiber on the fabric adjacent to the zipper, but crucially not on the edge. It lies between the very border of the tape and zipper. This anomaly impacts the fabric surrounding the zipper rather than the coil or teeth themselves, 3. shiny coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual shiny surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including any unusual shine. Additionally, this anomaly may sometimes cause the fabric to lie on the coil teeth themselves instead of just beside them, 4. rough coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual rough surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including rough or jagged edges, 5. partial split: chain is partially unzipped in a small section, causing a minor gap between the teeth, 6. compression distortion: coil appears deformed due to being tightly compressed, squeezed, or pinched. This distortion typically causes the individual teeth of the coil to overlap horizontally, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects. Choose the anomaly class of the image.

If on the coil: if portion of the surface looks rough, the defect is rough coil; If portion of the surface looks shiny, the defect is shiny coil; if the chain is partially unzipped with a minor gap, it is partial split; if the coil is squeezed or compressed, it is compression distortion. Finally, if multiple defects are present the defect class is multiple defects. Note that the predicted anomaly location is noisy, so the model should be able to classify the defect even if the predicted anomaly location is wrong. The anomaly classes are: 1. frayed tape edges: the textile tape edges have visible fraying or unraveling. This anomaly is strictly confined to the outermost edges of the zipper tape, regardless of texture, 2. fabric pilling: characterized by the presence of small balls of fiber on the fabric adjacent to the zipper, but crucially not on the edge. It lies between the very border of the tape and zipper. This anomaly impacts the fabric surrounding the zipper rather than the coil or teeth themselves, 3. shiny coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual shiny surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including any unusual shine. Additionally, this anomaly may sometimes cause the fabric to lie on the coil teeth themselves instead of just beside them, 4. rough coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual rough surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including rough or jagged edges, 5. partial split: chain is partially unzipped in a small section, causing a minor gap between the teeth, 6. compression distortion: coil appears deformed due to being tightly compressed, squeezed, or pinched. This distortion typically causes the individual teeth of the coil to overlap horizontally, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects. Choose the anomaly class of the image.

The normal zipper features two primary components: consists of two primary components: the tape and the coil. The tape is a fabric strip with a uniform texture and color, free from fraying or pilling. The coil is made of durable material, interlocking evenly with consistent spacing, and has a smooth surface without deformation. Classify the anomaly following this strict hierarchy: Location is the primary condition. First, determine if the anomaly is on the tape or the coil. If on the tape: if touches the outermost edge, it is frayed tape edges; if on fabric adjacent to the zipper but not touching the edge, it is fabric pilling. If on the coil: if portion of the surface looks rough, the defect is rough coil; If portion of the surface looks shiny, the defect is shiny coil; if the chain is partially unzipped with a minor gap, it is partial split; if the coil is squeezed or compressed, it is compression distortion. Finally, if multiple defects are present the defect class is multiple defects. Note that the predicted anomaly location is noisy, so the model should be able to classify the defect even if the predicted anomaly location is wrong. The anomaly classes are: 1. frayed tape edges: the textile tape edges have visible fraying or unraveling. This anomaly is strictly confined to the outermost edges of the zipper tape, regardless of texture, 2. fabric pilling: characterized by the presence of small balls of fiber on the fabric adjacent to the zipper, but crucially not on the edge. It lies between the very border of the tape and zipper. This anomaly impacts the fabric surrounding the zipper rather than the coil or teeth themselves, 3. shiny coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual shiny surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including any unusual shine. Additionally, this anomaly may sometimes cause the fabric to lie on the coil teeth themselves instead of just beside them, 4. rough coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual rough surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including rough or jagged edges, 5. partial split: chain is partially unzipped in a small section, causing a minor gap between the teeth, 6. compression distortion: coil appears deformed due to being tightly compressed, squeezed, or pinched. This distortion typically causes the individual teeth of the coil to overlap horizontally, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects. Choose the anomaly class of the image.

If on the coil: if portion of the surface looks rough, the defect is rough coil; If portion of the surface looks shiny, the defect is shiny coil; if the chain is partially unzipped with a minor gap, it is partial split; if the coil is squeezed or compressed, it is compression distortion. Finally, if multiple defects are present the defect class is multiple defects. Note that the predicted anomaly location is noisy, so the model should be able to classify the defect even if the predicted anomaly location is wrong. The anomaly classes are: 1. frayed tape edges: the textile tape edges have visible fraying or unraveling. This anomaly is strictly confined to the outermost edges of the zipper tape, regardless of texture, 2. fabric pilling: characterized by the presence of small balls of fiber on the fabric adjacent to the zipper, but crucially not on the edge. It lies between the very border of the tape and zipper. This anomaly impacts the fabric surrounding the zipper rather than the coil or teeth themselves, 3. shiny coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual shiny surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including any unusual shine. Additionally, this anomaly may sometimes cause the fabric to lie on the coil teeth themselves instead of just beside them, 4. rough coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual rough surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including rough or jagged edges, 5. partial split: chain is partially unzipped in a small section, causing a minor gap between the teeth, 6. compression distortion: coil appears deformed due to being tightly compressed, squeezed, or pinched. This distortion typically causes the individual teeth of the coil to overlap horizontally, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects. Choose the anomaly class of the image.

This anomaly impacts the fabric surrounding the zipper rather than the coil or teeth themselves, 3. shiny coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual shiny surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including any unusual shine. Additionally, this anomaly may sometimes cause the fabric to lie on the coil teeth themselves instead of just beside them, 4. rough coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual rough surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including rough or jagged edges, 5. partial split: chain is partially unzipped in a small section, causing a minor gap between the teeth, 6. compression distortion: coil appears deformed due to being tightly compressed, squeezed, or pinched. This distortion typically causes the individual teeth of the coil to overlap horizontally, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects. Choose the anomaly class of the image.

The tape is a fabric strip with a uniform texture and color, free from fraying or pilling. The coil is made of durable material, interlocking evenly with consistent spacing, and has a smooth surface without deformation. Classify the anomaly following this strict hierarchy: Location is the primary condition. First, determine if the anomaly is on the tape or the coil. If on the tape: if touches the outermost edge, it is frayed tape edges; if on fabric adjacent to the zipper but not touching the edge, it is fabric pilling. If on the coil: if portion of the surface looks rough, the defect is rough coil; If portion of the surface looks shiny, the defect is shiny coil; if the chain is partially unzipped with a minor gap, it is partial split; if the coil is squeezed or compressed, it is compression distortion. Finally, if multiple defects are present the defect class is multiple defects. Note that the predicted anomaly location is noisy, so the model should be able to classify the defect even if the predicted anomaly location is wrong. The anomaly classes are: 1. frayed tape edges: the textile tape edges have visible fraying or unraveling. This anomaly is strictly confined to the outermost edges of the zipper tape, regardless of texture, 2. fabric pilling: characterized by the presence of small balls of fiber on the fabric adjacent to the zipper, but crucially not on the edge. It lies between the very border of the tape and zipper. This anomaly impacts the fabric surrounding the zipper rather than the coil or teeth themselves, 3. shiny coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual shiny surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including any unusual shine. Additionally, this anomaly may sometimes cause the fabric to lie on the coil teeth themselves instead of just beside them, 4. rough coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual rough surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including rough or jagged edges, 5. partial split: chain is partially unzipped in a small section, causing a minor gap between the teeth, 6. compression distortion: coil appears deformed due to being tightly compressed, squeezed, or pinched. This distortion typically causes the individual teeth of the coil to overlap horizontally, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects. Choose the anomaly class of the image.

This anomaly is strictly confined to the outermost edges of the zipper tape, regardless of texture, 2. fabric pilling: characterized by the presence of small balls of fiber on the fabric adjacent to the zipper, but crucially not on the edge. It lies between the very border of the tape and zipper. This anomaly impacts the fabric surrounding the zipper rather than the coil or teeth themselves, 3. shiny coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual shiny surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including any unusual shine. Additionally, this anomaly may sometimes cause the fabric to lie on the coil teeth themselves instead of just beside them, 4. rough coil: portions of the coil exhibit an unusual rough surface texture compared to the rest. This anomaly can be characterized by changes directly on the teeth, including rough or jagged edges, 5. partial split: chain is partially unzipped in a small section, causing a minor gap between the teeth, 6. compression distortion: coil appears deformed due to being tightly compressed, squeezed, or pinched. This distortion typically causes the individual teeth of the coil to overlap horizontally, 7. multiple defects: if the object has multiple defects. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."
