The normal candle are round with a smooth, flat surface and have centered, unlit wicks. They appear uniformly white and are housed in circular metal containers. Follow this strict hierarchy for classification: First check for color contamination. If there is a redish spot, the defect is red spot. If it is distributed darker colors distributed in portion of wax, the defect is contamination. If there is no color change, check the location of anomaly for missing wax. If it is not exactly at the edge it is surface pitting. If it is at the edge it is either edge chipping or surface smearing. If it appears as a thin, elongated cut or notch, resembling a small slit in the wax surface it is edge chipping, if it appears as a small, rounded indentation or cavity, creating a slight depression in the wax surface it is surface smearing. The anomaly classes are: 1. surface pitting: presence of small holes or pits on any part of the candle's surface, excluding the edges, 2. edge chipping: small chips or pits located specifically along the edges of the candle, 3. red spot: presence of visible stains or discolorations on the surface of the candle, as indicated by red spots or marks that deviate from the uniform color, 4. contamination: presence of foreign particles or debris embedded on the surface of the candle, which may appear as dirt or specks disrupting the smooth texture, 5. surface smearing: irregular smears or deformations on the surface of the candle, particularly evident by streaks or uneven texture.

If it is not exactly at the edge it is surface pitting. If it is at the edge it is either edge chipping or surface smearing. If it appears as a thin, elongated cut or notch, resembling a small slit in the wax surface it is edge chipping, if it appears as a small, rounded indentation or cavity, creating a slight depression in the wax surface it is surface smearing. The anomaly classes are: 1. surface pitting: presence of small holes or pits on any part of the candle's surface, excluding the edges, 2. edge chipping: small chips or pits located specifically along the edges of the candle, 3. red spot: presence of visible stains or discolorations on the surface of the candle, as indicated by red spots or marks that deviate from the uniform color, 4. contamination: presence of foreign particles or debris embedded on the surface of the candle, which may appear as dirt or specks disrupting the smooth texture, 5. surface smearing: irregular smears or deformations on the surface of the candle, particularly evident by streaks or uneven texture.

If it appears as a thin, elongated cut or notch, resembling a small slit in the wax surface it is edge chipping, if it appears as a small, rounded indentation or cavity, creating a slight depression in the wax surface it is surface smearing. The anomaly classes are: 1. surface pitting: presence of small holes or pits on any part of the candle's surface, excluding the edges, 2. edge chipping: small chips or pits located specifically along the edges of the candle, 3. red spot: presence of visible stains or discolorations on the surface of the candle, as indicated by red spots or marks that deviate from the uniform color, 4. contamination: presence of foreign particles or debris embedded on the surface of the candle, which may appear as dirt or specks disrupting the smooth texture, 5. surface smearing: irregular smears or deformations on the surface of the candle, particularly evident by streaks or uneven texture.

If there is a color change, it is color spot. If there is a visible crack, it is breakage. The anomaly classes are: 1. color spot: presence of irregular color patches on the fryum. These spots can vary widely in color from darker hues like red to lighter shades similar to the fryum's base color, 2. stuck together: two individual fryums become inseparably fused together. It results in an irregular, combined shape that deviates from the typical singular form of a fryum, 3. breakage: crack or break within the structure of the fryum. The break can be seen as a distinct separation or gap disrupting the uniformity of the fryum. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

The normal macaroni1 depict typical elbow macaroni pasta pieces, which appear to be well-formed and consistent in shape. They exhibit a smooth, curved surface with a uniform golden-yellow color. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check the location. If the defect is mainly in the middle, check for a surface crack or breakage. If there is a surface crack, the anomaly is surface crack. If there is a breakage, it is central hole. If neither applies, check for color change. If the color is similar to the pasta, the defect is light color spot. If it is reddish or purplish, the defect is dark color spot. If the defect is only around the edge, check for a chip or breakage. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. The anomaly classes are: 1. edge chip: small piece missing from the edge of the macaroni, giving it an uneven contour. It's typically noticeable at the outermost part of the curved surface, 2. dark color spot: presence of a distinct reddish or purplish spot on one or more macaroni pieces. The spot contrasts noticeably with the natural color of the macaroni, 3. central hole:  noticeable hole or breakage in the middle part of the macaroni. It disrupts the regular cylindrical shape and creates a void that is evident when viewed from any angle, 4. light color spot: a spot that blends in with the macaroni's natural hue, making it harder to detect at first glance. The spot usually appears slightly darker or lighter but maintains a similar color tone to the surrounding pasta, 5. surface crack: fine, linear cracks or scratches along the surface of the macaroni. These imperfections are generally shallow but can be observed running along the length or circumference of the piece. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

If the color is similar to the pasta, the defect is light color spot. If it is reddish or purplish, the defect is dark color spot. If the defect is only around the edge, check for a chip or breakage. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. The anomaly classes are: 1. edge chip: small piece missing from the edge of the macaroni, giving it an uneven contour. It's typically noticeable at the outermost part of the curved surface, 2. dark color spot: presence of a distinct reddish or purplish spot on one or more macaroni pieces. The spot contrasts noticeably with the natural color of the macaroni, 3. central hole:  noticeable hole or breakage in the middle part of the macaroni. It disrupts the regular cylindrical shape and creates a void that is evident when viewed from any angle, 4. light color spot: a spot that blends in with the macaroni's natural hue, making it harder to detect at first glance. The spot usually appears slightly darker or lighter but maintains a similar color tone to the surrounding pasta, 5. surface crack: fine, linear cracks or scratches along the surface of the macaroni. These imperfections are generally shallow but can be observed running along the length or circumference of the piece. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

        "text": "The first image is a normal macaroni1. The second image is an anomalous macaroni1. The third image indicates the detected anomaly by a red line contour. The normal macaroni1 depict typical elbow macaroni pasta pieces, which appear to be well-formed and consistent in shape. They exhibit a smooth, curved surface with a uniform golden-yellow color. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check the location. If the defect is mainly in the middle, check for a surface crack or breakage. If there is a surface crack, the anomaly is surface crack. If there is a breakage, it is central hole. If neither applies, check for color change. If the color is similar to the pasta, the defect is light color spot. If it is reddish or purplish, the defect is dark color spot. If the defect is only around the edge, check for a chip or breakage. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. The anomaly classes are: 1. edge chip: small piece missing from the edge of the macaroni, giving it an uneven contour. It's typically noticeable at the outermost part of the curved surface, 2. dark color spot: presence of a distinct reddish or purplish spot on one or more macaroni pieces. The spot contrasts noticeably with the natural color of the macaroni, 3. central hole:  noticeable hole or breakage in the middle part of the macaroni. It disrupts the regular cylindrical shape and creates a void that is evident when viewed from any angle, 4. light color spot: a spot that blends in with the macaroni's natural hue, making it harder to detect at first glance. The spot usually appears slightly darker or lighter but maintains a similar color tone to the surrounding pasta, 5. surface crack: fine, linear cracks or scratches along the surface of the macaroni. These imperfections are generally shallow but can be observed running along the length or circumference of the piece. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

The normal macaroni1 depict typical elbow macaroni pasta pieces, which appear to be well-formed and consistent in shape. They exhibit a smooth, curved surface with a uniform golden-yellow color. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check the location. If the defect is mainly in the middle, check for a surface crack or breakage. If there is a surface crack, the anomaly is surface crack. If there is a breakage, it is central hole. If neither applies, check for color change.

If the color is similar to the pasta, the defect is light color spot. If it is reddish or purplish, the defect is dark color spot. If the defect is only around the edge, check for a chip or breakage. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. The anomaly classes are: 1. edge chip: small piece missing from the edge of the macaroni, giving it an uneven contour. It's typically noticeable at the outermost part of the curved surface, 2. dark color spot: presence of a distinct reddish or purplish spot on one or more macaroni pieces. The spot contrasts noticeably with the natural color of the macaroni, 3. central hole:  noticeable hole or breakage in the middle part of the macaroni. It disrupts the regular cylindrical shape and creates a void that is evident when viewed from any angle, 4. light color spot: a spot that blends in with the macaroni's natural hue, making it harder to detect at first glance. The spot usually appears slightly darker or lighter but maintains a similar color tone to the surrounding pasta, 5. surface crack: fine, linear cracks or scratches along the surface of the macaroni. These imperfections are generally shallow but can be observed running along the length or circumference of the piece. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

        "text": "The first image is a normal macaroni1. The second image is an anomalous macaroni1. The third image indicates the detected anomaly by a red line contour. The normal macaroni1 depict typical elbow macaroni pasta pieces, which appear to be well-formed and consistent in shape. They exhibit a smooth, curved surface with a uniform golden-yellow color. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check the location. If the defect is mainly in the middle, check for a surface crack or breakage. If there is a surface crack, the anomaly is surface crack. If there is a breakage, it is central hole. If neither applies, check for color change. If the color is similar to the pasta, the defect is light color spot. If it is reddish or purplish, the defect is dark color spot. If the defect is only around the edge, check for a chip or breakage. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. The anomaly classes are: 1. edge chip: small piece missing from the edge of the macaroni, giving it an uneven contour. It's typically noticeable at the outermost part of the curved surface, 2. dark color spot: presence of a distinct reddish or purplish spot on one or more macaroni pieces. The spot contrasts noticeably with the natural color of the macaroni, 3. central hole:  noticeable hole or breakage in the middle part of the macaroni. It disrupts the regular cylindrical shape and creates a void that is evident when viewed from any angle, 4. light color spot: a spot that blends in with the macaroni's natural hue, making it harder to detect at first glance. The spot usually appears slightly darker or lighter but maintains a similar color tone to the surrounding pasta, 5. surface crack: fine, linear cracks or scratches along the surface of the macaroni. These imperfections are generally shallow but can be observed running along the length or circumference of the piece. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

The normal macaroni1 depict typical elbow macaroni pasta pieces, which appear to be well-formed and consistent in shape. They exhibit a smooth, curved surface with a uniform golden-yellow color. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check the location. If the defect is mainly in the middle, check for a surface crack or breakage. If there is a surface crack, the anomaly is surface crack. If there is a breakage, it is central hole. If neither applies, check for color change. If the color is similar to the pasta, the defect is light color spot. If it is reddish or purplish, the defect is dark color spot. If the defect is only around the edge, check for a chip or breakage. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. The anomaly classes are: 1. edge chip: small piece missing from the edge of the macaroni, giving it an uneven contour. It's typically noticeable at the outermost part of the curved surface, 2. dark color spot: presence of a distinct reddish or purplish spot on one or more macaroni pieces.

If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. The anomaly classes are: 1. edge chip: small piece missing from the edge of the macaroni, giving it an uneven contour. It's typically noticeable at the outermost part of the curved surface, 2. dark color spot: presence of a distinct reddish or purplish spot on one or more macaroni pieces. The spot contrasts noticeably with the natural color of the macaroni, 3. central hole:  noticeable hole or breakage in the middle part of the macaroni. It disrupts the regular cylindrical shape and creates a void that is evident when viewed from any angle, 4. light color spot: a spot that blends in with the macaroni's natural hue, making it harder to detect at first glance. The spot usually appears slightly darker or lighter but maintains a similar color tone to the surrounding pasta, 5. surface crack: fine, linear cracks or scratches along the surface of the macaroni. These imperfections are generally shallow but can be observed running along the length or circumference of the piece. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

        "text": "The first image is a normal macaroni1. The second image is an anomalous macaroni1. The third image indicates the detected anomaly by a red line contour. The normal macaroni1 depict typical elbow macaroni pasta pieces, which appear to be well-formed and consistent in shape. They exhibit a smooth, curved surface with a uniform golden-yellow color. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check the location. If the defect is mainly in the middle, check for a surface crack or breakage. If there is a surface crack, the anomaly is surface crack. If there is a breakage, it is central hole. If neither applies, check for color change. If the color is similar to the pasta, the defect is light color spot. If it is reddish or purplish, the defect is dark color spot. If the defect is only around the edge, check for a chip or breakage. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. The anomaly classes are: 1. edge chip: small piece missing from the edge of the macaroni, giving it an uneven contour. It's typically noticeable at the outermost part of the curved surface, 2. dark color spot: presence of a distinct reddish or purplish spot on one or more macaroni pieces. The spot contrasts noticeably with the natural color of the macaroni, 3. central hole:  noticeable hole or breakage in the middle part of the macaroni. It disrupts the regular cylindrical shape and creates a void that is evident when viewed from any angle, 4. light color spot: a spot that blends in with the macaroni's natural hue, making it harder to detect at first glance. The spot usually appears slightly darker or lighter but maintains a similar color tone to the surrounding pasta, 5. surface crack: fine, linear cracks or scratches along the surface of the macaroni. These imperfections are generally shallow but can be observed running along the length or circumference of the piece. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

If the color is similar to the pasta, the defect is light color spot. If it is reddish or purplish, the defect is dark color spot. If the defect is only around the edge, check for a chip or breakage. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. The anomaly classes are: 1. edge chip: small piece missing from the edge of the macaroni, giving it an uneven contour. It's typically noticeable at the outermost part of the curved surface, 2. dark color spot: presence of a distinct reddish or purplish spot on one or more macaroni pieces. The spot contrasts noticeably with the natural color of the macaroni, 3. central hole:  noticeable hole or breakage in the middle part of the macaroni. It disrupts the regular cylindrical shape and creates a void that is evident when viewed from any angle, 4. light color spot: a spot that blends in with the macaroni's natural hue, making it harder to detect at first glance. The spot usually appears slightly darker or lighter but maintains a similar color tone to the surrounding pasta, 5. surface crack: fine, linear cracks or scratches along the surface of the macaroni. These imperfections are generally shallow but can be observed running along the length or circumference of the piece. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

The normal macaroni1 depict typical elbow macaroni pasta pieces, which appear to be well-formed and consistent in shape. They exhibit a smooth, curved surface with a uniform golden-yellow color. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check the location. If the defect is mainly in the middle, check for a surface crack or breakage. If there is a surface crack, the anomaly is surface crack. If there is a breakage, it is central hole. If neither applies, check for color change. If the color is similar to the pasta, the defect is light color spot. If it is reddish or purplish, the defect is dark color spot. If the defect is only around the edge, check for a chip or breakage. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. The anomaly classes are: 1. edge chip: small piece missing from the edge of the macaroni, giving it an uneven contour. It's typically noticeable at the outermost part of the curved surface, 2. dark color spot: presence of a distinct reddish or purplish spot on one or more macaroni pieces. The spot contrasts noticeably with the natural color of the macaroni, 3. central hole:  noticeable hole or breakage in the middle part of the macaroni.

If the color is similar to the pasta, the defect is light color spot. If it is reddish or purplish, the defect is dark color spot. If the defect is only around the edge, check for a chip or breakage. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. If it is a chip, the defect is edge chip. The anomaly classes are: 1. edge chip: small piece missing from the edge of the macaroni, giving it an uneven contour. It's typically noticeable at the outermost part of the curved surface, 2. dark color spot: presence of a distinct reddish or purplish spot on one or more macaroni pieces. The spot contrasts noticeably with the natural color of the macaroni, 3. central hole:  noticeable hole or breakage in the middle part of the macaroni. It disrupts the regular cylindrical shape and creates a void that is evident when viewed from any angle, 4. light color spot: a spot that blends in with the macaroni's natural hue, making it harder to detect at first glance. The spot usually appears slightly darker or lighter but maintains a similar color tone to the surrounding pasta, 5. surface crack: fine, linear cracks or scratches along the surface of the macaroni. These imperfections are generally shallow but can be observed running along the length or circumference of the piece. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

If there is a scratch, the defect is surface scratch. If not, check for color change. If it is whitish or yelloish, it is camouflaged spot. If it is dark or purplish, it is dark spot. If the defect location is solely at the edge and there is a chip, the defect is edge chipping. The anomaly classes are: 1. camouflaged spot: a spot that blends with the macaroni's natural yellowish color, creating a lighter, whitish or yellowish patch. These spots are subtle and may almost merge with the macaroni's surface tone, 2. dark spot:  a discolored area with a dark or purplish tint on one or more macaroni pieces. These spots stand out against the natural yellow color of the macaroni, 3. edge chipping: visible breakage or missing sections at the edges of the macaroni pieces. These chips or cracks can be seen as irregularities in the otherwise smooth cylindrical shape of the macaroni, 4. surface scratch: thin and shallow lines or abrasions running along the surface of the macaroni.

The normal macaroni2 the macaroni pieces exhibit a smooth and uniform yellowish color throughout. The edges are neatly rounded without any chips or cracks. There are no discolored spots or surface scratches present. Each piece maintains a consistent shape and texture with a slightly glossy finish. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check the location of defect. If the defect is mainly in the middle, check for a scratch or surface break. If there is a scratch, the defect is surface scratch. If not, check for color change. If it is whitish or yelloish, it is camouflaged spot. If it is dark or purplish, it is dark spot. If the defect location is solely at the edge and there is a chip, the defect is edge chipping. The anomaly classes are: 1. camouflaged spot: a spot that blends with the macaroni's natural yellowish color, creating a lighter, whitish or yellowish patch. These spots are subtle and may almost merge with the macaroni's surface tone, 2. dark spot:  a discolored area with a dark or purplish tint on one or more macaroni pieces.

The normal macaroni2 the macaroni pieces exhibit a smooth and uniform yellowish color throughout. The edges are neatly rounded without any chips or cracks. There are no discolored spots or surface scratches present. Each piece maintains a consistent shape and texture with a slightly glossy finish. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check the location of defect. If the defect is mainly in the middle, check for a scratch or surface break. If there is a scratch, the defect is surface scratch. If not, check for color change. If it is whitish or yelloish, it is camouflaged spot. If it is dark or purplish, it is dark spot. If the defect location is solely at the edge and there is a chip, the defect is edge chipping. The anomaly classes are: 1. camouflaged spot: a spot that blends with the macaroni's natural yellowish color, creating a lighter, whitish or yellowish patch. These spots are subtle and may almost merge with the macaroni's surface tone, 2. dark spot:  a discolored area with a dark or purplish tint on one or more macaroni pieces. These spots stand out against the natural yellow color of the macaroni, 3. edge chipping: visible breakage or missing sections at the edges of the macaroni pieces. These chips or cracks can be seen as irregularities in the otherwise smooth cylindrical shape of the macaroni, 4. surface scratch: thin and shallow lines or abrasions running along the surface of the macaroni.

There are no discolored spots or surface scratches present. Each piece maintains a consistent shape and texture with a slightly glossy finish. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check the location of defect. If the defect is mainly in the middle, check for a scratch or surface break. If there is a scratch, the defect is surface scratch. If not, check for color change. If it is whitish or yelloish, it is camouflaged spot. If it is dark or purplish, it is dark spot. If the defect location is solely at the edge and there is a chip, the defect is edge chipping. The anomaly classes are: 1. camouflaged spot: a spot that blends with the macaroni's natural yellowish color, creating a lighter, whitish or yellowish patch. These spots are subtle and may almost merge with the macaroni's surface tone, 2. dark spot:  a discolored area with a dark or purplish tint on one or more macaroni pieces. These spots stand out against the natural yellow color of the macaroni, 3. edge chipping: visible breakage or missing sections at the edges of the macaroni pieces. These chips or cracks can be seen as irregularities in the otherwise smooth cylindrical shape of the macaroni, 4. surface scratch: thin and shallow lines or abrasions running along the surface of the macaroni. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."

If there is a scratch, the defect is surface scratch. If not, check for color change. If it is whitish or yelloish, it is camouflaged spot. If it is dark or purplish, it is dark spot. If the defect location is solely at the edge and there is a chip, the defect is edge chipping. The anomaly classes are: 1. camouflaged spot: a spot that blends with the macaroni's natural yellowish color, creating a lighter, whitish or yellowish patch. These spots are subtle and may almost merge with the macaroni's surface tone, 2. dark spot:  a discolored area with a dark or purplish tint on one or more macaroni pieces. These spots stand out against the natural yellow color of the macaroni, 3. edge chipping: visible breakage or missing sections at the edges of the macaroni pieces. These chips or cracks can be seen as irregularities in the otherwise smooth cylindrical shape of the macaroni, 4. surface scratch: thin and shallow lines or abrasions running along the surface of the macaroni.

The anomaly classes are: 1. camouflaged spot: a spot that blends with the macaroni's natural yellowish color, creating a lighter, whitish or yellowish patch. These spots are subtle and may almost merge with the macaroni's surface tone, 2. dark spot:  a discolored area with a dark or purplish tint on one or more macaroni pieces. These spots stand out against the natural yellow color of the macaroni, 3. edge chipping: visible breakage or missing sections at the edges of the macaroni pieces. These chips or cracks can be seen as irregularities in the otherwise smooth cylindrical shape of the macaroni, 4. surface scratch: thin and shallow lines or abrasions running along the surface of the macaroni.

These spots stand out against the natural yellow color of the macaroni, 3. edge chipping: visible breakage or missing sections at the edges of the macaroni pieces. These chips or cracks can be seen as irregularities in the otherwise smooth cylindrical shape of the macaroni, 4. surface scratch: thin and shallow lines or abrasions running along the surface of the macaroni.

The anomaly classes are: 1. camouflaged spot: a spot that blends with the macaroni's natural yellowish color, creating a lighter, whitish or yellowish patch. These spots are subtle and may almost merge with the macaroni's surface tone, 2. dark spot:  a discolored area with a dark or purplish tint on one or more macaroni pieces. These spots stand out against the natural yellow color of the macaroni, 3. edge chipping: visible breakage or missing sections at the edges of the macaroni pieces. These chips or cracks can be seen as irregularities in the otherwise smooth cylindrical shape of the macaroni, 4. surface scratch: thin and shallow lines or abrasions running along the surface of the macaroni.

If there is a scratch, the defect is surface scratch. If not, check for color change. If it is whitish or yelloish, it is camouflaged spot. If it is dark or purplish, it is dark spot. If the defect location is solely at the edge and there is a chip, the defect is edge chipping. The anomaly classes are: 1. camouflaged spot: a spot that blends with the macaroni's natural yellowish color, creating a lighter, whitish or yellowish patch. These spots are subtle and may almost merge with the macaroni's surface tone, 2. dark spot:  a discolored area with a dark or purplish tint on one or more macaroni pieces. These spots stand out against the natural yellow color of the macaroni, 3. edge chipping: visible breakage or missing sections at the edges of the macaroni pieces. These chips or cracks can be seen as irregularities in the otherwise smooth cylindrical shape of the macaroni, 4. surface scratch: thin and shallow lines or abrasions running along the surface of the macaroni.

The term 'pins' refers exclusively to the 4-pin header connectors. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check for silver-colored solder or melting material, if found the defect is excess solder. If not found excess solder, check for missing component. Check the full presence of metal-can transducers if not count number of pins; if one of the transducers are missing or less that 4 pins are present, the defect is missing. If no excess solder and missing component found, check for scratches, specially on the board, resulting in scratch defect. If neither applies and none of solder, missing and scratch found and the pins are bent, the defect is bent pin. The anomaly classes are: 1. bent pin: one or more of the 4-pin header connector pins being misaligned significantlty, 2. excess solder: ccumulation of silver-colored solder material, usually appearing as blobs or excess spillover, 3. missing component: one or both cylindrical transducers or one of 4-pin headers are absent, 4. scratch: visible scratch lines on the pdb surface, specially in the PCB board.

Check the full presence of metal-can transducers if not count number of pins; if one of the transducers are missing or less that 4 pins are present, the defect is missing. If no excess solder and missing component found, check for scratches, specially on the board, resulting in scratch defect. If neither applies and none of solder, missing and scratch found and the pins are bent, the defect is bent pin. The anomaly classes are: 1. bent pin: one or more of the 4-pin header connector pins being misaligned significantlty, 2. excess solder: ccumulation of silver-colored solder material, usually appearing as blobs or excess spillover, 3. missing component: one or both cylindrical transducers or one of 4-pin headers are absent, 4. scratch: visible scratch lines on the pdb surface, specially in the PCB board.

The term 'pins' refers exclusively to the 4-pin header connectors. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check for silver-colored solder or melting material, if found the defect is excess solder. If not found excess solder, check for missing component. Check the full presence of metal-can transducers if not count number of pins; if one of the transducers are missing or less that 4 pins are present, the defect is missing. If no excess solder and missing component found, check for scratches, specially on the board, resulting in scratch defect. If neither applies and none of solder, missing and scratch found and the pins are bent, the defect is bent pin. The anomaly classes are: 1. bent pin: one or more of the 4-pin header connector pins being misaligned significantlty, 2. excess solder: ccumulation of silver-colored solder material, usually appearing as blobs or excess spillover, 3. missing component: one or both cylindrical transducers or one of 4-pin headers are absent, 4. scratch: visible scratch lines on the pdb surface, specially in the PCB board.

If not found excess solder, check for scratch marks or lines, if found the defect class is scratch. If not found excess solder or scratch, then check for missing component. Check the presence of components; if one of transistors, capacitors, 3-pin headers, or LEDs are absent, the defect is missing. If neither applies and none of solder, scratch, or missing found and one of the 3-pins or LEDs are bent, the defect is bent pin. The anomaly classes are: 1. bent pins: one of pins or LEDs in either sides of the board are visibly bent or misaligned, 2. excess solder: accumulation of silver-colored solder material, characterized by silver-colored blobs or smears on the board, 3. missing component: certain components like resistors, capacitors, pins, or LEDs are absent, 4. scratch: visible scratch lines or marks on the surface of the PCB board.

Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check for silver-colored solder or melting material, if found the defect is excess solder. If not found excess solder, check for scratch marks or lines, if found the defect class is scratch. If not found excess solder or scratch, then check for missing component. Check the presence of components; if one of transistors, capacitors, 3-pin headers, or LEDs are absent, the defect is missing. If neither applies and none of solder, scratch, or missing found and one of the 3-pins or LEDs are bent, the defect is bent pin. The anomaly classes are: 1. bent pins: one of pins or LEDs in either sides of the board are visibly bent or misaligned, 2. excess solder: accumulation of silver-colored solder material, characterized by silver-colored blobs or smears on the board, 3. missing component: certain components like resistors, capacitors, pins, or LEDs are absent, 4. scratch: visible scratch lines or marks on the surface of the PCB board.

The term 'pins' refers exclusively to the 3-pin header and white and black LEDs on the sides of the board. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check for silver-colored solder or melting material, if found the defect is excess solder. If not found excess solder, check for scratch marks or lines, if found the defect class is scratch. If not found excess solder or scratch, then check for missing component. Check the presence of components; if one of transistors, capacitors, 3-pin headers, or LEDs are absent, the defect is missing. If neither applies and none of solder, scratch, or missing found and one of the 3-pins or LEDs are bent, the defect is bent pin. The anomaly classes are: 1. bent pins: one of pins or LEDs in either sides of the board are visibly bent or misaligned, 2. excess solder: accumulation of silver-colored solder material, characterized by silver-colored blobs or smears on the board, 3. missing component: certain components like resistors, capacitors, pins, or LEDs are absent, 4. scratch: visible scratch lines or marks on the surface of the PCB board.

Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check for silver-colored solder or melting material, if found the defect is excess solder. If not found excess solder, check for scratch marks or lines, if found the defect class is scratch. If not found excess solder or scratch, then check for missing component. Check the presence of components; if one of transistors, capacitors, 3-pin headers, or LEDs are absent, the defect is missing. If neither applies and none of solder, scratch, or missing found and one of the 3-pins or LEDs are bent, the defect is bent pin. The anomaly classes are: 1. bent pins: one of pins or LEDs in either sides of the board are visibly bent or misaligned, 2. excess solder: accumulation of silver-colored solder material, characterized by silver-colored blobs or smears on the board, 3. missing component: certain components like resistors, capacitors, pins, or LEDs are absent, 4. scratch: visible scratch lines or marks on the surface of the PCB board.

If not found excess solder, check for scratch marks or lines, if found the defect class is scratch. If not found excess solder or scratch, then check for missing component. Check the presence of components; if one of transistors, capacitors, 3-pin headers, or LEDs are absent, the defect is missing. If neither applies and none of solder, scratch, or missing found and one of the 3-pins or LEDs are bent, the defect is bent pin. The anomaly classes are: 1. bent pins: one of pins or LEDs in either sides of the board are visibly bent or misaligned, 2. excess solder: accumulation of silver-colored solder material, characterized by silver-colored blobs or smears on the board, 3. missing component: certain components like resistors, capacitors, pins, or LEDs are absent, 4. scratch: visible scratch lines or marks on the surface of the PCB board.

The term 'pins' refers exclusively to the 3-pin header and white and black LEDs on the sides of the board. Follow this strict hierarchy for defect classification: First, check for silver-colored solder or melting material, if found the defect is excess solder. If not found excess solder, check for scratch marks or lines, if found the defect class is scratch. If not found excess solder or scratch, then check for missing component. Check the presence of components; if one of transistors, capacitors, 3-pin headers, or LEDs are absent, the defect is missing. If neither applies and none of solder, scratch, or missing found and one of the 3-pins or LEDs are bent, the defect is bent pin. The anomaly classes are: 1. bent pins: one of pins or LEDs in either sides of the board are visibly bent or misaligned, 2. excess solder: accumulation of silver-colored solder material, characterized by silver-colored blobs or smears on the board, 3. missing component: certain components like resistors, capacitors, pins, or LEDs are absent, 4. scratch: visible scratch lines or marks on the surface of the PCB board.

The normal pipe_fryum is uniformly shaped with smooth, intact edges and corners. Its surface is free of any scratches, chips, or uneven marks and lacks colored spots or blemishes. The anomaly classes are: 1. burn mark: characterized by an orangish-brownish patch that appears scorched or burnt, 2. edge breakage:  visible breakage or chipping, located around the corners or along the edges, 3. dark spot: characterized by a small, distinct dark spot on the fryum, 4. light spot: characterized by a small, light-colored spot that blends closely with the fryum's natural hue, 5. scratch: thin and shallow lines or abrasions running along the surface of the fryum, 6. stuck together: two or more fryums are adhered to each other, forming clusters. Choose the anomaly class of the image. Only return the class name."
